# Depth estimation CV project

This project seeks to explore the field of depth estimation from monocular images.

It has been developed by Alvaro Rubio as part of the subject "Computer Vision and Multimedia Analysis" taught by Proff. Nicola Conci in the University of Trento, Italy.

## Description of files (TBD)
###YOLO
Yolo algorithm code.
Create folder inside called "weights" and add the weight file from the download section before running the algorithm.

##Monodepth2
Depth estimation algorithm from monocular images. Slightly modified from source to retrieve relative depth estimation (no scale applied)
source: https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2

##preprocessing-code
Code for cropping the stereo images of the baseline in two monocular images. Preprocessed images can be find in "Left crop" in the download section.

##main.ipynb
Jupyter notebook. It includes the main code of this project. It is coded in an educational manner, i.e step by step, to facilitate the reuse or improvement of the code freely.
